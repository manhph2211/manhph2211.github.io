Hi,

I am currently a PhD student, deeply immersed in the realms of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Mobile Computing. My academic pursuits revolve around crafting comprehensive solutions that span the entire healthcare spectrum. Through the convergence of these technologies, I am devoted to developing end-to-end and scalable systems that empower individuals to seamlessly track their health and receive accurate diagnoses.

One of my focal points lies in the integration of ML/DL directly onto tiny devices. By capitalizing on the potential of lightweight models, I aim to revolutionize the way healthcare is accessed and delivered. Through my research, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of innovation, ensuring that intelligent healthcare solutions become an integral part of our daily lives.
