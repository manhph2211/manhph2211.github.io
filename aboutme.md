### My story

Studying in the field of Intelligent Electronics Systems and the Internet of Things at HUST is what I have chosen as my strong background in Physics. However, since I had a chance to approach Machine Learning, my mind was blown away. I was obsessed with how a machine can learn things and make predictions even more accurately than a human in many tasks. Also, I realized the enormous potential of this technology and how much it can contribute to many other aspects of life :smile: To my mind, I figured out my lifetime goal is absolutely becoming an expert about AIoT and being able to apply Machine Learning to address real-world problems. Therefore, I immediately dived into the field and devoted myself to absorb related knowledge âš¡
